## Student Information
`function _one()`

Create a JavaScript function that meets the following requirements:
* Creates the following variables that assign your unique profile information:
    - ***your_name***
    - ***number_of_courses***(this semester)
    - ***program***
    - ***part_time_ job***(true/false)
* Create a Boolean variable, set to **true** or **false**, based on whether you have a part time job. Store the string **“have"** or **“don’t have”** into another variable, based on the Boolean.
* Display your student information to the cosole *(console.log())* as illustrated below:  
> "My name is ***???***. I’m in the ***???*** program. I’m currently taking ***???*** courses." I ***???*** have a part time job.
> Where ***“???”*** should be replaced with your variable data
 
```Calling _one()```

```My name is Bruce Wayne. I'm in the T127 program. I'm currently taking 3 courses. I do not have a time job.```

## Calculate Change
`function _two(cents)`

Create a JavaScript function that meets the following requirements:
* Is passed an integer parameter, representing a number of Canadian cents.
* The function uses the parameter to determine the smallest number of Canadian quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies that are equal to the given (parameter) amount.
* Displays the calculated information as illustrated below:

```Calling _two(80)```

```80 cents in minimal change is: 3 quarters, 0 dimes, 1 nickels and 0 pennies.```

## Miles to Kilometers
`function _three(miles, kilometers)`

Create a JavaScript function that meets the following requirements:
* Receives two distances, one distance in miles and the other, a distance in kilometers value.
* Converts the miles to the equivalent kilometer value
* Converts the kilometer value to the equivalent miles
* Displays the calculated information as illustrated below:

```Calling _three(15,9)```

```15 miles = 24.14 Kilometers, 9 kilometers = 5.59 miles.```

## Find Min and Max
`function _four( array )`

Create a JavaScript function that meets the following requirements:
* Receives an integer array as a parameter
* The function transverses the array to determine the minimum and maximum values in the array.
* Displays the calculated information as illustrated below:

```Calling _four([-8,-1,-87,-14,-81,-74,-20,-86,-61,-10]);```

```The minimum valu in the array is: -87, the maximum value is -1```

## Count Occurrences

## Convert Number Grade to Letter Grade

## Reverse the Order of the Array

## School Days Remaining

## Count Vowels

## Alphabetical Order
